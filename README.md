# iblib

Go to the Simulo upload here: https://simulo.org/uploads/@interrobang/iblib
Go to the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/Interrobang01/iblib


Iblib (short for Interrobang's Library) is a library of Simulo Luau functions that you can use in whatever you want.
To get started, do

```
local iblib = require("./packages/@interrobang/iblib/lib/lib_loader.lua")
```

then, when you want to load a function, do

```
local function_name = iblib("function_name")
```

If that function is a component, it will return a string containing that component's code instead of a function. Use initialize_component to return a component hash instead.


### split_string
Python string split but in lua. Code courtesy of stackoverflow.

INPUTS:
- string, the string to test
- string, the separator; if it's longer than one character it'll treat them all as different separators and add them up, sort of like using an OR instead of an AND

OUTPUTS:
- table of strings, all the split substrings

### dump_table
Returns the input table in a form easily printable to console. Function courtesy of stackoverflow.

INPUTS:
- table, the table you want to dump

OUTPUTS:
- string, the table you want to dump but now easily printable

### is_point_in_polygon
Given a point and a table of points representing a polygon, returns whether the point is inside that polygon.

INPUTS:
- vec2, the point you want to test
- table of vec2 values, the polygon you want to test. Adjacent values are assumed to be connected.

OUTPUTS:
- boolean, true if inside

### middleclass
A third-party library for OOP in Lua, go to https://github.com/kikito/middleclass/wiki for documentation

### linear_algebra
A very tiny linear algebra library. Used with nodal_analysis.lua.

Included functions:

    ["create_matrix"]: Creates an empty n x n matrix

    ["solve_system"]: Solves the system A * x = B. Inputs are A and B, where A is a matrix and B is a vector.

### test_component
Given the name of an iblib component, creates a box with that component at (0,0) for testing purposes.

    dijkstra: Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.

    has_cycle: Detecting cycles in an undirected graph is useful for ensuring graph structures like trees.

    is_connected: This function checks if the graph is fully connected (i.e., there is a path between any two nodes).
    
    topological_sort: Useful for scheduling tasks or resolving dependencies.

    find: Helper function to find a node's set in union-find structure
    
    union: Helper function to union two sets
    
    kruskal: Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is used to find a minimum spanning tree for a graph.

Makes the object accelerate based on its angle. The idea is to make it fly around like a hose but it doesn't do that right now

### maintain_x (component)
Makes the object maintain its horizontal position by setting its velocity to the difference between the desired x value and the current x value.

### curved (component)
Makes the object take a curved path when moving.

### swirl (component)
Makes it so that when the object rotates, it rotates things around it with it.

### maintain_y (component)
